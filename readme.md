## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

Since Kruti AI does not have a public API, this extension cleverly automates the process of getting an answer:

1.  When you ask a question, the extension constructs a special URL (`https://www.kruti.ai/?prompt=...`).
2.  It opens this URL in a new, hidden background tab. This URL automatically submits your query to Kruti AI.
3.  A content script is then injected into that background page.
4.  This script patiently watches the answer box on the page. As Kruti AI streams the answer, the script captures the full HTML content in real-time.
5.  The captured HTML is sent back to the extension's popup, which displays it live.
6.  Once the AI stops writing for a moment, the script sends a final "finished" signal, and the background tab is automatically closed.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Since this is a custom extension, you need to load it manually in Developer Mode.

1.  Open your browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions` (or `brave://extensions` for Brave).
2.  In the top-right corner, turn on the **Developer mode** toggle switch.
    
3.  Click the **Load unpacked** button that appears on the top-left.
4.  In the file selection window, navigate to and select the entire `Kruti AI Extension` folder.
5.  The "Kruti AI Companion" will now appear in your list of extensions, and its icon will be added to your toolbar!
